## Instructions:

1- First, explore the Next.js file. Take a look around at the structure of the files. Which components are imported and which are exported, etc.

2- Currently, the variable `count` can not be updated in the UI. Re-create the variable using `useState` hook.

3- Create three functions that correspond to the three already existing functions:
Increment: Adds 1 to the count.
Decrement: Removes 1 from the count.
Reset: Brings the count back to 0.

4- Make sure to call the functions in their respective buttons using `onClick`.

\*Bonus:
After finishing all the above, why don't you lift the state up? How would you do it?


____________
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
